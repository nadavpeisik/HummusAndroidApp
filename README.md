This was a passion project we wanted to make for a long time. It is improving both the dining experience for the customers and the work environment for the restaurant staff, and for that we are very happy.

We leave this project as a reference for other beginner Android developers who want to build their first app using the latest libraries and tools, focusing heavily on Jetpack Compose, including navigation, material design, accompanist, and animations. We know firsthand how hard it is to find documentation and actual code examples for the way things work in compose.

This project is hopefully good as a reference as it goes beyond the examples covered in the [official compose samples](https://github.com/android/compose-samples) by having a lot of logic implemented and not just UI.
